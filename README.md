# Regularized-Least-Squares-Approximation-using-Orthogona-Polynomials
This is a collection of MATLAB codes of numerical experiments in our paper "Regularized Weighted Discrete Least Squares Approximation by Orthogonal Polynomials" (with C. An). This paper is available on [arXiv:1805.01140](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01140)
To run these test codes, one should install the fantastic [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/), also can be acquired on [GitHub](https://github.com/chebfun), which is developed by Oxford's Numerical Analysis Group.
